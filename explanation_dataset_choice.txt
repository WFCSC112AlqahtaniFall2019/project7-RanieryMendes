My dataset is about the Fires that happened in the Amazon Rain Forest in Brazil from 1998 to 2017. I selected it because I believe it is such a pressing issue, especially because l and since the current president got in office Amazon as a whole has suffered a lot. Therefore, I think it is very interesting and important to learn more about the rising, critical numbers of fires in Amazon, because it clearly shows that the most important forest in the world is going through such a dangerous, harmful moment.
